# SmartBatteryExtension
A smart battery extension solution designed for electric scooters in Ottawa (eScooters)

## Project description
Our project, "SmartBatteryExtension," aims to provide a solution to the seasonal limitations of e-scooter usage on our campus in Ottawa. With the goal of enabling year-round transportation, we are developing an integrated system that offers real-time battery monitoring and automatic controls. This system, equipped with a Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) battery pack, ensures e-scooters can reliably operate in harsh winter conditions, making them a convenient and eco-friendly choice for students. For comprehensive project details, including prerequisites, project setup, cost, and data flow, please refer to the accompanying [FinalReport PDF]() in this GitHub repository. The Python script included in the repository is designed to be run on the Raspberry Pi. We encourage contributions and welcome inquiries.
